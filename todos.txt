[v0.5]

1. Finish adding the GitHub Workflows: 
	Reusable: 
		[note: these: 0. auth into 'git' using your credentials; 1. run 'npm version (patch|minor)', 2. 'git add .; git commit -m "..."; git push']
		1. make-release-patch.yml - creates a patch-release for the project (incremental /w 2.)
		2. make-release-minor.yml - creates a minor-release for the project (incremental /w 1.)

		[separate commit - just in case...]; 
		3. npm-deploy - [on push to 'main' - DO IT LAST]: 
			0. runs the 'run-tests' workflow as a reusable workflow
			1. npm publish

		Fix: 	

			1. string: 
				1. extract - add a 'global' call from the 'parsers.js' 'regex' submodule;
					Reason - it's impossible to use '.split' with non-global 'regex'; 

					For this to be good - SEPARATE the 'regex' submodule of 'parsers.js' into 'make-regex' npm package, 
						which would (basically) be a whole new module. 

					Then - one.js can import it [and subsequently EXPORT it, as part of the "combination-package" thing], TOGETHER
						with 'parsers.js' [due to: 1. how conviniently it fits with parsers.js functionality; 2. that it already IS a dependency - why not export it as well?]

			2. for types: 
				1. Use 'NoInfer' where beneficial [example: 'functional.constant']; 

	1. functional programming library in JavaScript: 
		Let the 'functional' module be moved there...
		The purpose of one.js is: 

			1. to provide refactoring for some simple/elementary expressions (like 'array.out')
			2. to serve as a "clarifier" for existing JS API that is far too complex (the '.splice' method for instance...)
			3. to provide solutions to simple algortihms (like 'set.uniqueArr')
		
		Even though the 'trivialCompose' IS extremely common-place, it is still (technically) a functional utility; 

	2. create a new library called 'shape.js', which would elaborate on the idea of 'structCheck'. 
		Particularly: 

			1. It would introduce a new class called Shape, which would be the basis for 'structCheck' [rename to 'Shape.is']
				The shapes would also be [method enumeration]: 

					1. comparable [checkable for equality]
					2. intersectable [intersections of different shapes would be findable]
					3. disjoinable [possible if it's impossible for a given object to have 2 types at the same time]

					4. constructable: 	
						There would be the '.or' and '.and' predicate-methods for constructing new shapes from current ones. 
					
					5. constructor-like: 
						It would be possible to construct new object of given shape using specialized 'Shape.prototype.construct' method

			2. There would be the 'is' function, that would take a list of 'Shape's, then return a set of 'Shape's that 
				the given object possesses.
	
	3. create a new library 'object.js', based off the 'one.js/object' submodule
		The 'object.js' library would (then) become the 'one.js/object' submodule [library-level refactoring]

	4. refactor all the stuff from 'type' submodule into a specialized 'typeof.js' module. 
		This 'typeof.js' module would then become a dependency of 'one.js' that is exported;

	5. refactor all the stuff from 'array' and 'inplace' submodules into 'array.js' module. 
		Then - split the dependency of 'one.js' that is the 'array.js' into 'inplace' and 'array'

	6. add a new package 'bits' for "common" functions for working with binary data, binary interfaces
		Later (when it grows large enough), refactor into another library 'bits.js'
	
	NOTE: after all this - the 'one.js' [more or less] finishes its development, one never touches its "structCheck" part again. 
		And - the package [more or less] does not update anymore, only occasionally - to work on the remaining "small" modules:

			1. boolean
			2. map
			3. number
			4. string

		7. IDEA: [possibly] try to put these small functions into respective submodules, 
			so that nothing would be "lost". 

			BUT - here, retain the ordering [in that - the code would come from FEWER libraries, but the number of submodules would remain the same]. 
			Libraries-modules distribution would be: 

				1. boolean -> functional 
				2. number -> functional 
				3. map -> object/map [note: this is a submodule of the 'object.js' separate module]
				4. string -> functional/string [note: this is a submodule of the functional library]

	8. 'scale.js' - a scalable utility library. 
		It would contain various functions, such as 'array.map', 'array.filter' [which execute BETTER than '.map' and '.filter' WHEN the inputs are large enough/have certain properties].
			The library would provide 'fastMap', 'fastFilter', ..., to work with large pieces of data [for which it is more optimal to choose these manual solutions than the builtin Array.prototype methods]; 
			THIS WAY, let the 'array.js' [and other such libraries] be USED by the 'scale.js'; 

			TODO: create more similar functions for non-Array datatypes

	9. About 'npm run paranoid' - [note for self: generally, when trying out the WSL - introduce into this scheme 2 more items: 
		1. pre-testing [via pre-npm-run-test + a specialized run-all script]
		2. publishing ONLY if the tests pass successfully [possibly - write a specialized npm module/gist for that? So that the user may import the respective function into their own script and be done with it???]
	]

		Particularly, the 'npm run paranoid' should look something like in Bash: 

			rm -rf dist && && npm run all && (npm pack > packing.txt)

		With an updated 'npm run all' being: 	

			npm run build && npm run test-compile && npm run test
	
	10. make the .yml files in the '.github/workflows' a GitHub Gist [expecting those to be rather frequently used...]; 

	11. make the 'forkSync' function into a micro-module on 'npm': 
		Call the package: 'fork_sync'
