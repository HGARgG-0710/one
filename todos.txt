1. Add new functions: 
	1. [module] 'functions': 
		1.1. id = (x) => x
		1.2. void = () => {}
	2. [module] 'object'
		2.1.???[maybe] Various methods for conversion from a 'pairs-list' to an object; 
		2.2. Allow the user to RESTRICT certain properties on object from occurring; 
		2.3. Allow the user to have a STRICT type (one that is described completely by the given properties); 
	3. [module] 'boolean'
		3.1. equals := (x, y) => x === y
	4. [module] 'typeof': 
		4.1. isNull 	 := (x) => x === null
		4.2. isUndefined := (x) => x === undefined

2. Optimize (what little there is): 
	2.1. Minimize copying;
